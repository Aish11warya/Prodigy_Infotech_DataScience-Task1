# Prodigy_Infotech_DataScience-Task1
## OBJECTIVE

The objective of this task is to create a bar chart or histogram in order to display the distribution of either a categorical or continuous variable. For example, analyzing how different age groups or genders are distributed within a population.

## WORK DESCRIPTION
For Task 1 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship, I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. The focus was on developing meaningful visualizations, specifically bar charts and stacked chart, to represent the distribution of a chosen categorical or numerical feature. This helps in understanding the underlying patterns in the data, such as population distribution across genders or age groups.

## TOOLS & LIBRARIES

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## DATASETS

For this task, I utilized the [(world population data)](worldpopulationdata.csv), which provides yearly population statistics ranging from 2001 to 2022. This dataset serves as the basis for performing data analysis and visualization.
